# Diagrams

This folder contains **generic and shared diagrams** that apply across multiple case studies or represent general system design patterns.

## Structure

- `c4/` - Generic C4 model diagrams (context, container, component patterns)
- `sequence/` - Generic sequence diagrams for common patterns

## Case Study Specific Diagrams

**Important**: Each case study has its own `diagrams/` folder containing diagrams specific to that case study. This keeps related content together and makes maintenance easier.

For case study specific diagrams, see:
- `../07_case-studies/[case-study-name]/diagrams/`
