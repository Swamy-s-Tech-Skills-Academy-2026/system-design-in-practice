# Scalability

This topic is split into two parts to keep the material modular.

- Start here: [Scalability in System Design (Part 1)](./03_scalability-part1.md)
- Continue: [Scalability in System Design (Part 2)](./03_scalability-part2.md)

*Recommended path: Read Part 1 → Part 2 → then the [Scale from Zero to Million Users](../07_case-studies/01-scalefromzerotomillonusers/README.md) case study.*
