# Consistency

This topic is split into two parts to keep the material modular.

- Start here: [Consistency (Part 1)](./04_consistency-part1.md)
- Continue: [Consistency (Part 2): Design Patterns and Implementation](./04_consistency-part2.md)

---

*Recommended path: Read Part 1 → Part 2 → then revisit consistency choices in your case studies.*
