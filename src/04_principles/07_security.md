# Security

This topic is split into two parts to keep the material modular.

- Start here: [Security (Part 1)](./07_security-part1.md)
- Continue: [Security (Part 2): Best Practices and Implementation](./07_security-part2.md)

---

*Recommended path: Read Part 1 → Part 2 → then apply these controls in each case study (authn/authz, rate limiting, secrets, logging).*
