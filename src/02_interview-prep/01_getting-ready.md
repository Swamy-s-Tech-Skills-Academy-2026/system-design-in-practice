# Getting Ready for System Design Interviews

System design interviews evaluate **how you think**, not how much you remember. Preparation is less about memorizing architectures and more about developing a **structured, calm, and defensible reasoning process**.

---

## Understanding the Interview Format

Most system design interviews follow this structure:

1. **Problem statement**
   Example: “Design a URL shortener” or “Design a news feed”.

2. **Clarification & requirements**
   Functional vs non-functional requirements.

3. **High-level design (HLD)**
   Major components and data flow.

4. **Deep dives**
   Scaling, data models, APIs, failure handling.

5. **Trade-offs & alternatives**
   Why one approach over another.

Interviewers are assessing:

- Clarity of thought
- Ability to reason under ambiguity
- Communication and prioritization
- Practical experience signals

---

## Essential Preparation Strategies

- Practice **structured thinking**, not scripts
- Get comfortable **thinking out loud**
- Always start broad, then go deep
- Use estimation to guide design choices
- Justify decisions with trade-offs

Preparation should train you to **navigate uncertainty confidently**.

## Fundamental Concepts to Master

Before attempting case studies, ensure strong understanding of:

- Scalability vs performance
- Consistency models
- Load balancing
- Caching strategies
- Databases (SQL vs NoSQL)
- Messaging systems
- Failure modes

Weak fundamentals cannot be hidden by good diagrams.

## Key Resources

- This repository (primary)
- Real-world postmortems
- Architecture blogs from large tech companies
- Mock interviews (human or AI)

## Key Takeaway

Being “ready” means you can **start any system design problem without panic** and progress methodically.
