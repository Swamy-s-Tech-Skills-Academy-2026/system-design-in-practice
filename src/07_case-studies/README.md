## Case Study Structure

Each case study follows this structure:

- `requirements.md` - Functional and non-functional requirements
- `high-level-design.md` - System architecture and component interactions
- `low-level-design.md` - Detailed design of components
- `scalability.md` - Scaling strategies and considerations
- `trade-offs.md` - Design decisions and their trade-offs
- `diagrams/` - Case study specific diagrams (C4, sequence, architecture)

**Note**: Diagrams are co-located with each case study for better organization and maintainability. The main `src/diagrams/` folder is reserved for generic/shared diagrams that apply across multiple case studies.
