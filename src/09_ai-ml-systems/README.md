# AI & ML Systems in Practice

This section focuses on **Gen AI System Design** and **ML System Design**, building on the same principles, building blocks, and patterns used throughout this repository.

## Scope

- **Gen AI Systems**: LLM-backed applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector search, prompt orchestration, evaluation, and safety.
- **ML Systems**: Training pipelines, feature stores, online/offline serving, experimentation, and monitoring for models in production.

## Planned Topics

### 1. Gen AI System Design (LLM-centric)

- High-level reference architecture for LLM applications
- Prompt handling, routing, and orchestration
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
- Vector stores and embeddings
- Evaluation, safety, and feedback loops

### 2. ML System Design (Model-centric)

- Data collection and labeling pipelines
- Training, validation, and model registry
- Online inference and batch inference
- Feature stores and feature serving
- Experimentation, A/B testing, and model monitoring

### 3. Operational Topics (MLOps, LLMOps, PromptOps)

- MLOps foundations (data, features, models, monitoring)
- LLMOps foundations (RAG, orchestration, evaluation, safety)
- PromptOps patterns (versioning, testing, and governance)

## Relationship to Other Sections

- Builds on **Foundations** (`src/03_foundations/`) and **Principles** (`src/04_principles/`).
- Reuses **Building Blocks** (`src/05_building-blocks/`), especially databases, caches, queues, search, and monitoring.
- Connects to **Patterns** (`src/06_patterns/`) like caching, rate limiting, and event-driven architectures.
- Complements AI-oriented **Case Studies** such as `src/07_case-studies/chatgpt/`.

## Status

- Structure and topics: **Planned**
- Detailed content: **To be added**
